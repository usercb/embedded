Smart Farm in Cloud 


Build your smart farm system in cloud! Your system should satisfy following requirements. 

Monitor temperature and lightness on every 1ms
Use an analogous data for a ligthness sensor. 
Build a server in cloud and install MySQL and Apache into it. 
(you can use any sort of a cloud service or use your desktop as a server)
Send sensor data from Raspberry Pi to the server every 10s. 
Turn on FAN when the temperature goes beyond 20 degrees (C)  for 5 second. 
Turn on LED when the lightness goes below ____ and turn off it otherwise. 
Each functionality should be performed by an independant thread (use multi-threaded programming, 4 threads) 
Use a signal mechanism when threads need to communicate each other. 
Collect data for more than 1 minute. 
Capture the screen showing data statistics on the web server. 
(This screen shot should be included in a git repository and a final report).
